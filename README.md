# GroceryTracking

The aim of this program is to take a text file and read from it from a Python Script and use the methods in it to perform actions.

Through out this project, I modified the Python Script to handle different requests from the C++ Program and utilized C++ based Python interpreter from the University to handle different requests. 

I modified the Python interpreter and changed some of the layout of what it does for the program.

Leveraging the Python Script this program is able to handle Reading the text file, pulling a single line value from the text file and converting the text file to a dat file to then be interpreted by the C++ program.

The C++ program is capable of calling the required Python methods and assisting with those methods. It is also setup to read from the dat file, create a vector of the values found in the dat file and then display those as a histogram. After each primary function call in the C++ program it shows the user the main menu again until they exit it of their own desire from the Exit command found in the Main Menu.
